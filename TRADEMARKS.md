# Trademark Usage Guidelines

## Permission Required
rideOS owns, or has licensed, trademarks used to identify its activities.  You will need our permission to use our logos or trademarks.  If you are working with us on a project or initiative, please work with your rideOS contact to coordinate third-party marketing permissions.

## Our brand terms and conditions
You may use our trademark and/or logo in relation to an implementation you release based on our product as long as you follow the usage requirements in these guidelines and you obtain our advance permission in writing (“Agreement”).  You must: (i) only use the images of our trademark that we make available to you, without altering them in any way; (ii) only use our trademarks in connection with the Agreement; and (iii) immediately comply if we request that you discontinue use.  

In the absence of your obtaining advance permission in writing, and subject to all conditions in these guidelines, you may, without our written permission, use our trademark(s) only in word mark form (i.e., no logos) solely to identify our open source software release(s) that we identify with the trademark(s).  For example, you may identify your software as being based on “the rideOS (TM) open source rider SDK available on GitHub.”  You are required to provide an attribution to rideOS in association with such use in the following form: “rideOS and the rideOS logo are the trademarks of rideOS.”

If permission is granted to you to use our trademark, you must not: (i) use our trademark in a misleading or disparaging way; (ii) use our trademark in a way that implies we endorse, sponsor or approve of your services or products; or (iii) use our trademark in violation of applicable law or in connection with an obscene, indecent, or unlawful topic or material.

## You may not do any of the following:
* Combine any of our marks with your name, your marks, or any generic terms
* Incorporate any of our marks into your name or logo
* Change the color of our logo
* Photoshop or otherwise modify our logo
* Use old versions of our logo
* Use our logo as a letter in any word, other than where published by us
* Add words directly around the logo
* Overlap our logo with shapes or photos
* Associate our marks with any vulgar, obscene, indecent or unlawful material
* You may not create a Twitter handle or other social media account whose username or title could suggest affiliation with or endorsement by us.
* You may not use our marks in any advertising creative or copy (digital, social, pay-per-click or otherwise). This includes phrases too, such as “rideOS Partner” or “rideOS Design Certified.”
* You may not use a trademark, domain name, or logo that imitates or could be confused with our marks.
